The MRST faultve module presented here combines a vertical equilibrium model with
an upscaled fault leakage function (which is geomechanically constrained) to
model large scale co2 storage simulations and undertand the impact of parameter uncertainty 
in a rapid manner.

Please refer to the technical report and the documents for more information
about the modelling methods

There are 3 example simulations presented here

- A gently sloping aquifer with a leaking fault
- Field scale co2 storage simulation in a faulted aquifer
- Kmeans clustering analysis workflow for field scale co2 storage simulation

Make sure you register this module within your local mrstpaths. 
One would need to type the following command in the command window.
The syntax after faultve refers to the location of the faultve folder.
Please add the corresponding folder path from your system.

For windows this looks something like depending on the location of the folder:
mrstPath register faultve C:\Users\fd85\Documents\MATLAB\mrstmodules\faultve

For Mac this looks something like: 
mrstPath register faultve ~/Sourcetree/faultve
