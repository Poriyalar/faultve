The MRST faultve module presented here combines a vertical equilibrium model with
an upscaled fault leakage function to model large scale co2 storage simulations 
and undertand the impact of parameter uncertainty  in a rapid manner.

Please refer to the manuscript for more information about the modelling methods
"Rapid Fault Leakage Modeling for CO2 Storage in Saline Aquifers".
DOI - https://doi.org/10.31223/X5S12N

There are 2 example simulations presented here

- A gently sloping aquifer with a leaking fault
- Field scale co2 storage simulation in a faulted aquifer

Make sure you register this module within your local mrstpaths. 
One would need to type the following command in the command window.
The syntax after faultve refers to the location of the faultve folder.
Please add the corresponding folder path from your system.

For windows this looks something like depending on the location of the folder:
mrstPath register faultve C:\Users\fd85\Documents\MATLAB\mrstmodules\faultve

For Mac this looks something like: 
mrstPath register faultve ~/Sourcetree/faultve
